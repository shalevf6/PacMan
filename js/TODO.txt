Hi Shalevf!
first of all SHTAK... always remember that!

here are some stuff that has been done:
1. pacman is moving
2. ghosts are moving by manhattan distance
3. collision detection is working
4. code separation has been made

here are some stuff needs to be done:
MUST HAVE:
1. audio JS file with audio. bring whatever you like, i trust you - V
2. connect audio to game at decent places (collision, general, pacGotBusted and so...) - V
3. add a running character. do it similarly to how the ghosts are moving (without manhattan) - it's all in Ghosts JS
4. make sure that settings are well connected to Game_Handler.js (you can see that there is a section TMP SETTINGS - those need to be connected)
5. fix pac-man landing right on points
6. fix points on corners.
7. fix timer.
8. add out of seconds game over.

NICE TO HAVE:
1. pacman, ghosts and character moving intervals.
2. cool restart when pacman gets busted
3. end game theme or graphic or some other 'shit' (you are an idiot ;))

START WITH MUST HAVE.
you don't have to finish with everything, we'll be in touch i might be back early tomorrow.

yalla bye.

ADDED:
1. added Mute button.
2. added Eat and caught sounds.
3. added game sound.
4. added time interval to create countdown timer in seconds.
5. added game interval to end game if time ends.
6. fixed game ending in countdown.
7. transferred willBeDeleted important stuff and deleted it.
