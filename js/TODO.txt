Hi Shalevf!
first of all SHTAK... always remember that!

here are some stuff that has been done:
1. pacman is moving
2. ghosts are moving by manhattan distance
3. collision detection is working
4. code separation has been made

here are some stuff needs to be done:
MUST HAVE:
1. audio JS file with audio. bring whatever you like, i trust you
2. connect audio to game at decent places (collision, general, pacGotBusted and so...)
3. add a running character. do it similarly to how the ghosts are moving (without manhattan) - it's all in Ghosts JS
4. make sure that settings are well connected to Game_Handler.js (you can see that there is a section TMP SETTINGS - those need to be connected)
5. fix pac-man landing right on points

NICE TO HAVE:
1. pacman, ghosts and character moving intervals.
2. cool restart when pacman gets busted
3. end game theme or graphic or some other 'shit' (you are an idiot ;))

START WITH MUST HAVE.
you don't have to finish with everything, we'll be in touch i might be back early tomorrow.

yalla bye.
